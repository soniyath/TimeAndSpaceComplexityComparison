# TimeAndSpaceComplexityComparison
A C program to compare 3 sorting algorithms including Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Quick Sort. This assignment will help you understand how the sorting algorithms work, the efficiency of the sorting algorithms when having different sizes of input, and the comparison of them in terms of time complexity.

Purpose : For knowing the difference between different types of sorting and storing algorithms within the range of time and space complexity where the time is measured with each cycle of the repeated attempts for sorting the algorithms and the time of each cycle is noted and an average of all the tested times is outputted which is really necessary for all the applications for making the processing faster; as a result much more can be achieved with smoothness and quickness the user deserves.
